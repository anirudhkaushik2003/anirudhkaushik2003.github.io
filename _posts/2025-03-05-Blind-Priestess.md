        A strange scent, diffused light, muted as it passed through the lids of her closed eyes. She turned her head and smiled. The click of the key turning in its lock, the sound of the door opening. She stood and felt the back of her chair. The scent, the soft thuds which approached her. Flowers, the scent gave them away. A gift. She pretended to be surprised, the soft smile never leaving her. It grew wider as their fingers brushed in the exchange.

        The shuffling of packages, the opening of lids, the scent of food. She felt the back of the chair and sat down once more. She tracked with her sightless gaze, following the movements around the kitchen. The prattling about the day, the clinking of cutlery, the sock-clad thuds on the linoleum. She placed her hands on the table as she received the warm plate, the cutlery gently placed in her palms. She leaned down till she could feel the heat of the meal on her chin. 

        The chattering continued as they both ate. The fork searching for her lips to prevent the sting of the sauces and the condiment. A bit too harsh for her preference but she rarely complained. The cutting of meat and the soft chewing of closed lips, she could feel it in her left ear, mixing with the adorable voice she loved. She ate at a slower pace and she could feel the patient waiting in the voice, dinner was not the focus.

        She set her fork down and placed the knife besides it. A napkin gently dabbed her smiling lips and she could feel the warm of the delicate fingers that tended to her. The plates were cleared and a hand found hers. The anticipated familiarity of the warmth. As it pulled her closer, she inhaled.

        A strange scent, unfamiliar, but not unkind. A weariness. Her brows furrowed. She leaned in closer till her nose felt the warmth of their neck and inhaled once more. But the scent had passed and she felt the faithful warmth as it guided her to their place of rest. The tales continued, in her right ear, the kind lilt of their voice, the heat of their uncalloused palm in her hand. 

        She felt the bed sink in as she sat down and she waited for it to sink in again. The air was colder here and it only made her wait for their warmth that much longer. She tapped her fingers on the mattress as she felt the breathing grow closer, till it finally joined her. She laid down and closed her already shut eyes. A blanket wrapped around her shoulders and then was adjusted at her back. She felt a satisfied nod near her as the mattress shifted. She was pulled closer and anchored at the waist and it made her blush. A content sigh behind her and the soft weight on her lulled her to sleep.
