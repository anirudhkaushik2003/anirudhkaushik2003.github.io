# Two at a time

No matter how much she tried, her little legs just won’t stretch that far. She couldn’t climb the steps two at a time. She begged her father to teach her, a man who could climb 3 steps with a single lunge. He told her that climbing more than one step at a time was not very lady like and that she should put her foolish ambitions to rest. But the girl was no giver upper. However determined she may be, she was no fool, jumping on the stairs was forbidden. The only way forward was to stretch and grow her legs.

Everyday the girl would stretch. She asked the local farmers to tie her legs to their horses and pull but all she got was a whack. When hard work didn’t work, the girl resorted to prayer and offered her younger brother but the gods did not lend her their ear.

One night, a monster crept into the girls’ basement. The monster heard a little girl of 10 receive a scolding from a man of 40 for “wasting electricity”. The door swung open and the little girl made her way down the stairs and towards the light. The monster readied itself. As soon as the light went out, the monster dashed towards the girl. The girl ran, the monster chased. The girl began climbing the stairs one at a time, and the monster climbed them two at a time. 

The girl knew that she would be caught if she didn’t do something. She jumped! She leapt and covered 3 stairs, becoming faster than the monster. But the forbidden rule was broken. The house roared and shrieked. Two hands popped out and lifted the porch up, as if lifting its pants. The house got up and left, leaving behind a staircase which led to no floor, a girl and a monster.
