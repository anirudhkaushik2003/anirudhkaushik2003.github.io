This was the third of a series of 3 "proper" sketches that I attempted. Proper in terms of the amount of time I was willing to spend in making them.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/layers-of-fear-subject.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Subject, An oil painting by the MC from Layers of Fear 
</div>

### Chosing the subject
Layers of Fear was full of interesting painting such as the one below

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/satan.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Satan devouring his son by Francisco Goya
</div>

However, there wasn't much to sketch in this one. 
There were several paintings of the MC's wife, in various stages of burns

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/layers-of-fear-subject.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/layers-of-fear.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Subject and final sketch
</div>
