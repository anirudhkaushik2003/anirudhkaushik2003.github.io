Sleeping. Sleeping. Waking up to a strange ceiling. Messy routines and then school. At school, she once again drifted off and before she knew it she was back home. She blinked and it was night time. She decided to brush her teeth. A pretty face smiled at her from the mirror which made her blush. She thought about it as she walked to her bed in her fluffy slippers, her mouth feeling minty fresh. She laid her head on the pillow and wondered about the person in the mirror and all of a sudden it was morning. 

She moved slowly down the stairs, her fluffy slippers on her feet. She rubbed her eyes and yawned and found herself answering a question in class. She asked to go to the washroom in hopes of finding the girl who had smiled at her. She opened the door to the girls washroom but found her self back at home instead. She removed her shoes and walked to the kitchen. She passed by the calendar which told her it was friday. Her mother was cooking her favourite stew. She sat down at the table and watched as her mom stirred the pot. 

“How was school today?” 

“The usual”

“What about that boy you’re always talking about”

“He’s also fine, I guess”

“You two had a fight?”

“I don’t think so?!?”

The girl stretched her arms and legs at the same time and let out a big exhale. She opened her eyes to her mother and her brother greeting their father at the door. “I brought that juice you wanted to try from that new store that we passed by last saturday”, “Ah, thank you”, “It comes in a glass bottle and everything, you can share it with your brother in your room. I have something to discuss with mom” 

The girl walked up to the room, her fluffy slippers make soft thuds as she climbed the steps two at a time. Her little brother followed on all fours. She poured him a glass and one for herself. She opened the window and a cool summer breeze filled the room. Her brother asked her for some more juice and she handed him the bottle. She sat on a cushion and she watched her brother greedily suck on the bottle. Only a little while before she could meet the girl from the mirror. 

She heard loud noises coming from below, her parents. She could hear her mother sobbing. Just a few more minutes till 9pm. Her mother entered the room and picked up the little boy and carried him away. The bottle lay on the ground in a puddle of juice. The girl walked to the washroom and switched on the light, it was bright and it hurt her eyes. She stood infront of the sink, still no sign of the girl. She brushed and brushed till her gums bled, still no sign of the girl. Finally, she gave up and turned to return. 

Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a faint smile and it made her heart pound. She felt a smile of her own spread across her face. She lay on the bed, blushing. As she turned to face the wall, she found it was already morning.
