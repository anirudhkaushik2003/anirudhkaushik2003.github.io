Sketching a comic strip. 
For the project of a particular course, children were allowed creative freedom. One child in particular decided to make a video game and a comic strip to go along with it. He felt this was not sufficient so he also promised a detailed analysis of various algorithms. 
</p>
<p>Later, this child suffered from 3 large brain tumors due to unrelated reasons </p>

### Story for Part 1
 1. There's a little girl who's plucking endangered species of flowers from a forest
 2. A forest Official comes to stop her and tells her he'll call his supervisor
 3. She gets scared and runs but gets stuck near a cliff because *somebody* didn't smoothen out the terrain

 ### Story for Part 2
 1. Really nice artistic sketch
 2. There's a bare world without anything
 3. You have to fill it up while making sure it's still traversable

### Final Thoughts 
 - Summer vacation, passion fruit sodas and pan pizzas
 - Melanoma is the most common skin cancer in young adults, susceptibility increases if you've experienced sunburns in your childhood
