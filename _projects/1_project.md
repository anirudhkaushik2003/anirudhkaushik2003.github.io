A 2d platformer game built from scratch in pygame. The game features a procedurally generated random world made using simplex noise, 3 different kinds of enemies: Minotaurs, Harpies and a really fast big guy whom I regret adding.

Play as little red riding hood, collect flowers for your grandma (there isn't one yet) and avoid/kill the forest creatures.

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.  -->


<!-- <div class="row justify-content-sm-center">

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

<!-- 
The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
``` -->
{% endraw %} -->
