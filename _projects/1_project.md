A 2d platformer game built from scratch in pygame. The game features a procedurally generated random world made using simplex noise, 3 different kinds of enemies: Minotaurs, Harpies and a really fast big guy whom I regret adding.

Play as little red riding hood, collect flowers for your grandma (there isn't one yet) and avoid/kill the forest creatures.
